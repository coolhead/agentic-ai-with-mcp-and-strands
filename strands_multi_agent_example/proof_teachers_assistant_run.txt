Here’s a simple Python function to check if a string is a palindrome (ignoring punctuation/spaces and case):

```python
def is_palindrome(s: str) -> bool:
    cleaned = ''.join(ch.lower() for ch in s if ch.isalnum())
    return cleaned == cleaned[::-1]

print(is_palindrome('A man, a plan, a canal, Panama'))  # True
print(is_palindrome('hello'))  # False
```
